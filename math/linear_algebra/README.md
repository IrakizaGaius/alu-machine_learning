# Linear Algebra Project

Welcome to the Linear Algebra Project! Dive into the fascinating world of linear algebra and explore its essential concepts and real-world applications.

## Why Linear Algebra?

Linear algebra is the backbone of many areas in mathematics and science, including machine learning, computer graphics, and engineering. Mastering these concepts will give you a powerful toolset for solving complex problems and understanding the world around you.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you'll be equipped with a solid understanding of:

- **Vectors and Matrices:** Learn what they are and how they are used in computations.
- **Matrix Operations:** Discover the operations you can perform on matrices, including transpose, slicing, and element-wise operations.
- **Matrix Multiplication & Dot Product:** Understand how matrices interact with each other and their applications.
- **Numpy:** Get hands-on experience with Numpy, a fundamental library in Python for numerical computations.
- **Parallelization & Broadcasting:** Explore these advanced techniques to optimize your code and make it more efficient.

## Requirements

For this project, make sure you have:

- **Python Scripts:** Developed and tested on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS with Python 3.5.
- **Numpy (version 1.15):** Essential for handling array operations.
- **Pycodestyle:** Ensure your code follows Python style guidelines.
- **Documentation:** All modules, classes, and functions should be well-documented.
